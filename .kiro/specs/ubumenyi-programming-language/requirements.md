# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Ubumenyi Programming Language is designed to make programming accessible to native Kirundi speakers by providing a programming environment that uses Kirundi keywords, syntax, and concepts. The name "Ubumenyi" means "Knowledge" in Kirundi, reflecting the goal of democratizing access to computational knowledge and skills. This language will serve as a bridge between traditional programming concepts and the natural linguistic patterns of Kirundi speakers, reducing the cognitive load of learning programming by eliminating the need to translate English programming terms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a native Kirundi speaker, I want to write code using Kirundi keywords and syntax, so that I can focus on learning programming logic without the barrier of English language translation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user writes code using Kirundi keywords THEN the language SHALL parse and execute the code correctly
2. WHEN a user declares variables using Kirundi syntax THEN the system SHALL store and retrieve variable values appropriately
3. WHEN a user writes conditional statements in Kirundi THEN the system SHALL evaluate conditions and execute appropriate code branches
4. WHEN a user defines functions using Kirundi keywords THEN the system SHALL create callable function objects with proper scope handling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a programming educator in Burundi, I want to teach programming concepts using familiar Kirundi terminology, so that students can better understand and retain programming fundamentals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN educators use Kirundi programming constructs in lessons THEN students SHALL be able to understand the syntax without English translation
2. WHEN students write their first programs THEN they SHALL use natural Kirundi expressions for common programming operations
3. WHEN error messages are displayed THEN they SHALL be presented in clear Kirundi language
4. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL be written in Kirundi with culturally relevant examples

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Ubumenyi language to support fundamental programming constructs, so that I can build meaningful applications and solve real-world problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to perform arithmetic operations THEN the language SHALL support basic mathematical operations using Kirundi operators
2. WHEN I need to work with different data types THEN the language SHALL support numbers, text, lists, and boolean values with Kirundi type names
3. WHEN I need to control program flow THEN the language SHALL provide loops, conditionals, and function calls using Kirundi syntax
4. WHEN I need to handle input and output THEN the language SHALL provide mechanisms to read user input and display results in Kirundi

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a software developer familiar with other programming languages, I want to understand how Ubumenyi maps to familiar programming concepts, so that I can contribute to its development and help others learn it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine Ubumenyi code THEN I SHALL be able to identify equivalent constructs in mainstream programming languages
2. WHEN I write Ubumenyi programs THEN the language SHALL follow consistent and predictable syntax rules
3. WHEN I encounter Ubumenyi language features THEN they SHALL have clear documentation explaining their purpose and usage
4. WHEN I need to extend the language THEN the architecture SHALL support adding new keywords and constructs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Kirundi speaker learning to program, I want clear and helpful error messages in my native language, so that I can understand and fix problems in my code quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN syntax errors occur THEN the system SHALL display error messages in clear Kirundi language
2. WHEN runtime errors happen THEN the system SHALL provide helpful explanations in Kirundi about what went wrong
3. WHEN variable or function names are misspelled THEN the system SHALL suggest corrections using Kirundi terminology
4. WHEN logical errors are detected THEN the system SHALL provide guidance in Kirundi for debugging approaches

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user of the Ubumenyi language, I want an interactive environment where I can experiment with code, so that I can learn programming concepts through hands-on practice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start the Ubumenyi interpreter THEN I SHALL see a welcoming prompt in Kirundi
2. WHEN I type expressions in the interactive mode THEN the system SHALL evaluate and display results immediately
3. WHEN I make mistakes in interactive mode THEN the system SHALL provide gentle corrections in Kirundi
4. WHEN I want to exit the interactive mode THEN I SHALL be able to use a Kirundi command to quit gracefully
